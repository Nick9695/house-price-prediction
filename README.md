**Predict real estate values with precision!**

## Overview

This data science project utilizes linear regression to predict house prices based on key characteristics. We dive into the Kaggle House Prices Dataset, meticulously cleaning and engineering features to optimize our model's accuracy.

## Key Features ‚ú®

* **Comprehensive Data Exploration:** Gain insights through visualizations and statistical analysis.
* **Custom Feature Engineering:** Extract maximum value from the dataset.
* **Robust Linear Regression Model:** Trained and tuned for accurate predictions.
* **Clear Evaluation Metrics:** Measure the model's performance objectively (RMSE, MAE, R-squared).

## Dataset üìä

The project leverages the renowned [Kaggle House Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data), offering a rich set of features for analysis.
